# Task 3: AXI Interconnect Fabric

**Title:** High-Throughput AXI Interconnect

**Objectives:**
Design an AXI (Advanced eXtensible Interface) interconnect fabric to connect multiple masters and slaves. Optimize for minimal latency and high throughput.

**Challenges:**
*   Arbitrating between multiple masters requesting access to the same slave.
*   Buffering data and control signals to decouple masters and slaves.
*   Implementing address decoding logic to route transactions to the correct slave.
*   Handling AXI protocol signals correctly (valid, ready, etc.).
*   Supporting different AXI transaction types (read, write, burst).

**Verification Considerations:**
*   Use AXI VIP (Verification IP) to model AXI masters and slaves.
*   Verify the interconnect's ability to handle concurrent transactions.
*   Implement coverage metrics to ensure complete test coverage of all AXI protocol features.
*   Use assertions to check protocol adherence.

**Optional Extensions:**
*   Implement quality of service (QoS) mechanisms to prioritize certain transactions.
*   Add support for AXI4-Stream protocol.
*   Optimize the interconnect for low area.
