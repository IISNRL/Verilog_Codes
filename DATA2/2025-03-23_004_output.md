# Report: Pipelined RISC-V Processor

## 1. Task Description

This report details the design and implementation of a 5-stage pipelined RISC-V processor core, compliant with the RV32I base integer instruction set. The primary goal is to design an efficient processor core that maximizes instruction throughput (IPC) while ensuring correct program execution.  This involves addressing common pipeline hazards, including data hazards (RAW, WAR, WAW) and control hazards (branch instructions).

The problem aims to create a functional and reasonably optimized RISC-V core suitable for embedded applications or as a learning platform. Optimizing for IPC requires carefully managing the pipeline and minimizing stalls caused by dependencies and branch mispredictions.

The processor core design encompasses several key components:

*   **Instruction Fetch (IF):** Fetches instructions from memory.
*   **Instruction Decode (ID):** Decodes the instruction and reads operands from the register file.
*   **Execute (EX):** Performs the arithmetic or logical operation specified by the instruction.
*   **Memory Access (MEM):** Reads from or writes to memory (if required).
*   **Write Back (WB):** Writes the result back to the register file.

Successfully completing this task requires a thorough understanding of computer architecture principles, pipeline design, and RISC-V ISA. It also demands proficiency in Verilog HDL for hardware description and simulation.

## 2. Verilog Codes

The following Verilog code represents a simplified, conceptual implementation of a 5-stage pipelined RISC-V processor.  It highlights key aspects of the design, but excludes some details like full hazard detection and resolution logic for brevity and clarity in this report. A full implementation is beyond the scope of this simplified illustration.

## 3. Code Explanation

The `riscv_pipeline` module implements a basic 5-stage pipelined RISC-V processor.  Each `always_ff @(posedge clk)` block represents a pipeline stage. The stages are:

1.  **IF (Instruction Fetch):**  Fetches the next instruction from memory based on the program counter (PC).  The `next_pc` is calculated and updated, handling the basic increment.

2.  **ID (Instruction Decode):** Decodes the instruction fetched from memory and reads the required operands from the register file. The register addresses (rs1, rs2) are extracted from the instruction.

3.  **EX (Execute):** Performs the arithmetic/logic operation specified in the decoded instruction. The ALU result is calculated based on the decoded instruction and input operands.

4.  **MEM (Memory Access):**  Performs memory read or write operations if required by the instruction. The `data_mem_addr` is driven by the ALU result, and `data_mem_data_out` is driven by register data when performing a store.

5.  **WB (Write Back):** Writes the result of the instruction back to the register file.  The `writeback_data` can come from the ALU result or memory read value, depending on the instruction.

**Key Design Considerations:**

*   **Pipelining:** Instructions are processed concurrently in different stages, increasing throughput (IPC).
*   **Register File:** The `register_file` array simulates the 32 RISC-V registers.
*   **Instruction Memory:**  The `instruction_memory` array simulates the instruction memory. A more realistic implementation would use an external memory interface.
*   **Data Memory:** The testbench has a VERY simplified memory model for read/write to data memory. A real core would need a proper data memory interface and module.
*   **Control Signals:**  Control signals (`reg_write_enable`, `mem_read`, `mem_write`, `alu_op`) are generated in the ID stage based on the decoded instruction and are used in subsequent stages to control the processor's behavior.  These are highly simplified examples.
*   **Hazards:**  This simplified implementation does *not* include full hazard detection and resolution logic.  Data hazards (RAW, WAR, WAW) and control hazards (branches) are critical aspects of pipeline design.  Real-world processors use techniques like forwarding (bypassing) and stalling to handle hazards, which are not fully implemented here.
*   **Branch Prediction:**  The simple branch logic updates `next_pc`.  A full implementation would include branch prediction hardware (e.g., branch target buffer) to reduce the impact of branch instructions on pipeline performance.

## 4. Testbench

The `riscv_pipeline_tb` provides a basic testbench for the `riscv_pipeline` module.

**Testing Methodology:**

1.  **Reset:** The `rst` signal is asserted initially to reset the processor.

2.  **Clock Generation:** A clock signal is generated using an `always` block.

3.  **Instruction Loading:** Instructions are manually loaded into the `instruction_memory` by assigning values to `instruction_mem_data_in` at specific time steps, which simulates the act of reading from a memory containing a program. The loading is spaced out to represent instructions being fetched sequentially.

4.  **Data Memory Simulation:** A very basic model of data memory is simulated where write operations are displayed.

5.  **Monitoring:** The testbench monitors the output signals of the `riscv_pipeline` module, such as `data_mem_addr`, `data_mem_data_out`, and `data_mem_write_enable`.

**Test Cases:**

The example testbench executes a sequence of `addi` instructions to load values into registers x1, x2, x3, x4, and x5. These test cases are relevant because they verify the basic functionality of the instruction fetch, decode, execute, and write-back stages for a simple arithmetic operation.  A complete testbench would include tests for all RV32I instructions, as well as specific tests for hazard scenarios (RAW, WAR, WAW) and branch instructions.

*   **addi x1, x0, 1:**  Verifies that the ALU can perform addition and that the result is written back to register x1.
*   **addi x2, x0, 2:** Verifies correct operation on a second register.
*   **addi x3, x0, 3:** Verifies correct operation on a third register.
*   **addi x4, x0, 4:** Verifies correct operation on a fourth register.
*   **addi x5, x0, 5:** Verifies correct operation on a fifth register.

## 5. Expected Output

The expected output of the testbench is that the `addi` instructions will correctly update the corresponding registers in the `register_file`. Because the simulation dump is enabled in the testbench, you would view the `riscv_pipeline.vcd` file in a waveform viewer. In the waveform viewer, you can observe that the `register_file` is updated with the expected values (x1 = 1, x2 = 2, x3 = 3, x4 = 4, x5=5) over time as the instructions pass through the pipeline.

The data memory section of the testbench only displays a message when a write occurs. Because the sample program only loads registers with constants, there are no expected writes to data memory.

Because of the extremely simplified nature of this processor and testbench, you'd expect to see the registers being updated after a few clock cycles, as the instructions flow through the pipeline.

## 6. Notes

*   **Limitations:** This is a significantly simplified implementation of a RISC-V processor. It lacks crucial features like:
    *   Full RV32I instruction set support.
    *   Comprehensive hazard detection and resolution (forwarding, stalling).
    *   Branch prediction.
    *   Interrupt handling.
    *   A complete memory interface.
*   **Optimizations:** Several optimizations are possible, including:
    *   Implementing forwarding paths to reduce stalls caused by data hazards.
    *   Adding a branch target buffer (BTB) to improve branch prediction accuracy.
    *   Optimizing the ALU implementation for performance.
    *   Adding support for out-of-order execution (requires significant complexity).
*   **Potential Enhancements:**
    *   Add support for compressed instructions (RV32C).
    *   Add support for floating-point instructions (RV32F).
    *   Implement a cache memory system to improve memory access performance.
*   **Verification Best Practices:**
    *   Thoroughly test all RV32I instructions and hazard scenarios.
    *   Use a RISC-V ISA simulator (e.g., Spike) to verify the processor's output against expected results.
    *   Consider using formal verification tools to prove the correctness of the pipeline.
    *   Utilize a RISC-V compliance test suite to ensure adherence to the ISA.

This report provides a basic overview of a pipelined RISC-V processor design.  A complete and robust implementation requires significantly more detail and complexity, particularly in hazard handling, branch prediction, and memory system design.
