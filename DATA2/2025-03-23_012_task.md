# Task 12: Image Processing Pipeline

**Title:** High-Dynamic-Range (HDR) Image Processing Pipeline

**Objectives:**
Design a high-dynamic-range (HDR) image processing pipeline that enhances the contrast and detail of images captured by a camera sensor.

**Challenges:**
*   Implementing tone mapping algorithms to compress the dynamic range of the image.
*   Performing noise reduction and detail enhancement.
*   Handling different color spaces and formats.
*   Optimizing the pipeline for throughput and image quality.
*   Managing data movement between different processing stages.

**Verification Considerations:**
*   Use a set of HDR images to test the pipeline.
*   Compare the processed images with the original images using objective metrics (e.g., PSNR, SSIM).
*   Analyze the visual quality of the processed images.
*   Verify the pipeline's ability to handle different types of noise and artifacts.

**Optional Extensions:**
*   Add support for different HDR formats (e.g., Dolby Vision, HDR10).
*   Implement adaptive tone mapping algorithms.
*   Optimize the pipeline for low power consumption.
