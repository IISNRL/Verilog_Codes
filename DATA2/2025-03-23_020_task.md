# Task 20: Advanced Cryptographic Coprocessor

**Title:** Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Coprocessor

**Objectives:**
Design a coprocessor to accelerate post-quantum cryptographic algorithms (e.g., Kyber, Dilithium). Optimize for speed, area, and power efficiency.

**Challenges:**
*   Implementing the complex mathematical operations required by PQC algorithms (e.g., polynomial multiplication, matrix operations).
*   Managing large data structures and memory access patterns.
*   Protecting against side-channel attacks (SCA) due to the computational complexity.
*   Optimizing the coprocessor for parallel processing and pipelining.
*   Addressing the significant resource requirements of PQC.

**Verification Considerations:**
*   Use standardized PQC test vectors to verify the correctness of the implementation.
*   Compare the performance with a reference software implementation.
*   Analyze the resistance to known side-channel attacks.
*   Measure the area and power consumption of the coprocessor.

**Optional Extensions:**
*   Add support for multiple PQC algorithms.
*   Implement countermeasures against advanced side-channel attacks.
*   Optimize the coprocessor for low power consumption and embedded applications.
