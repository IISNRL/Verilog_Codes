# Network-on-Chip (NoC) Router

## Objectives
Design a 2D mesh NoC router with a wormhole routing algorithm. The router should support multiple virtual channels to prevent deadlock.

## Challenges
*   **Wormhole Routing:** Implement the wormhole routing algorithm, dividing messages into flits and forwarding them through the network.
*   **Virtual Channels:** Implement multiple virtual channels to prevent deadlock and improve throughput.
*   **Flow Control:** Implement flow control mechanisms to prevent buffer overflow.
*   **Arbitration:** Design an arbitration scheme to resolve conflicts when multiple flits compete for the same output port.

## Verification Considerations
*   **Traffic Generator:** Create a traffic generator to simulate network traffic and test the router's performance.
*   **Deadlock Detection:** Implement a deadlock detection mechanism to verify the absence of deadlocks.
*   **Throughput Measurement:** Measure the router's throughput under different traffic patterns.

## Optional Extensions
*   **Adaptive Routing:** Implement adaptive routing to dynamically adjust the routing path based on network congestion.
*   **Quality of Service (QoS):** Implement QoS mechanisms to prioritize certain traffic flows.
*   **3D NoC:** Extend the design to a 3D NoC architecture.
