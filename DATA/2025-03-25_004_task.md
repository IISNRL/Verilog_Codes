# High-Speed Memory Controller (DDR4)

## Objectives
Design a simplified DDR4 memory controller capable of handling basic read and write operations. Focus on timing and synchronization.

## Challenges
*   **Timing Constraints:** Adhere to strict DDR4 timing constraints (e.g., tDQSQ, tRCD, tRP).
*   **Synchronization:** Implement robust synchronization mechanisms to handle the high clock frequencies and data rates.
*   **Burst Mode:** Support burst mode transfers for improved performance.
*   **Command/Address/Data Separation:** Handle the separation of command, address, and data signals.

## Verification Considerations
*   **Timing Simulation:** Perform extensive timing simulation to verify that the controller meets all timing constraints.
*   **Eye Diagram Analysis:** Analyze the eye diagram of the data signals to ensure signal integrity.
*   **Memory Model:** Use a simplified memory model to represent the DRAM device.

## Optional Extensions
*   **Error Correction:** Implement error correction codes (ECC) to improve data reliability.
*   **Refresh Cycle:** Implement the DRAM refresh cycle.
*   **Power Management:** Implement power management techniques to reduce power consumption.
