# High-Speed Memory Controller (DDR5) Report

## 1. Task Description

**Aim:** This project aims to design a simplified DDR5 memory controller capable of handling basic read and write operations. The controller will focus on accurately implementing the core aspects of the DDR5 protocol, particularly timing and synchronization.

**Overview:** The DDR5 memory controller acts as an interface between a system processor and a DDR5 DRAM module. It translates the processor's memory requests (read/write addresses, data) into the specific command sequences and timing signals required by the DRAM.  It manages the DRAM's state machine (precharge, activate, read, write, refresh) and ensures data integrity.

**Significance of Design Approach:**  A simplified design allows for a focused understanding of the complexities of DDR5 timing and protocol.  This approach prioritizes clarity and educational value over maximum performance or feature completeness.  The focus on timing synchronization is crucial because even slight timing errors can lead to data corruption and system instability.  The burst mode implementation maximizes data throughput by transferring multiple data words in a single operation.  The basic ECC provides a minimal level of data protection.

## 3. Code Explanation

The `ddr5_controller` module implements a simplified DDR5 memory controller.

* **Parameters:** `DATA_WIDTH`, `ADDR_WIDTH`, and `BURST_LENGTH` define the data bus width, address width, and burst length, respectively.
* **Internal Signals:** `internal_addr` stores the address received from the processor. `internal_data_out` holds the data to be written to the DRAM. `state` tracks the current state of the controller. `state_counter` is used for timing delays.
* **State Machine:** The controller uses a state machine to manage the DRAM's operations. The states include:
    * `IDLE`: The controller is idle, waiting for a read or write request.
    * `PRECHARGE`: Precharges the DRAM.
    * `ACTIVATE`: Activates a row in the DRAM.
    * `READ`: Reads data from the DRAM.
    * `WRITE`: Writes data to the DRAM.
    * `REFRESH`: Refreshes the DRAM.
    * `REFRESH_DELAY`: Delay after refresh.
* **Timing:** The code includes basic timing considerations.  The state transitions are intended to represent the approximate timing of DDR5 operations.  More sophisticated timing would require more complex state counters and potentially external timing signals.
* **Data Output:** The `data_out` signal holds the data to be written to the DRAM.
* **Control Signals:** `wr_n`, `rd_n`, `n_precharge`, `n_activate`, and `n_refesh` are the control signals that drive the DRAM.
