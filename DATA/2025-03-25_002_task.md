# AES-GCM Accelerator

## Objectives
Design a hardware accelerator for the Advanced Encryption Standard in Galois/Counter Mode (AES-GCM). The accelerator should handle both encryption and decryption.

## Challenges
*   **AES Core:** Implement the AES core using a SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, and AddRoundKey transformation.  Consider using a lookup table for SubBytes.
*   **Galois/Counter Mode (GCM):** Implement the GCM mode, including the counter increment and XOR operation.
*   **Authentication:** Implement the authentication process using the Galois field multiplication.
*   **Parallelism:** Explore opportunities for parallelization within the AES and GCM operations.

## Verification Considerations
*   **Test Vectors:** Use standard AES-GCM test vectors to verify the correctness of the accelerator.
*   **Reference Implementation:** Compare the accelerator's output with a software reference implementation.
*   **Timing Analysis:** Analyze the timing of the accelerator to ensure it meets performance requirements.

## Optional Extensions
*   **Hardware-Friendly Design:** Optimize the design for efficient hardware implementation (e.g., minimizing critical path).
*   **Variable Block Size:** Support variable block sizes for increased flexibility.
*   **Side-Channel Attack Mitigation:** Implement techniques to mitigate side-channel attacks (e.g., masking).
