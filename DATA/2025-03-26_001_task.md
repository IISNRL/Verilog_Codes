# RISC-V Core with Branch Prediction

## Objectives
Design a simplified, single-cycle RISC-V core with a basic branch predictor. The core should execute a subset of RISC-V instructions (e.g., R-type, I-type, S-type, and a limited set of J-type instructions). The branch predictor should reduce pipeline stalls due to mispredicted branches.

## Challenges
*   **RISC-V Subset Implementation:** Accurately implement the specified RISC-V instruction set.  Handle register file operations, ALU operations, memory access, and control logic.
*   **Pipeline Design:** Implement a 2-stage pipeline (Instruction Fetch & Execute).  Manage data hazards and control hazards.
*   **Branch Prediction:** Implement a 1-bit branch predictor.  Handle predictor updates and stall the pipeline when a misprediction occurs.
*   **Control Hazard Resolution:**  Flush the pipeline on mispredicted branches.

## Verification Considerations
*   **Testbench Development:** Create a comprehensive testbench with a variety of RISC-V programs, including loops, conditional statements, and function calls.
*   **Waveform Analysis:** Use waveform analysis to observe the pipeline stages and verify correct instruction execution.
*   **Coverage Metrics:**  Employ code coverage and functional coverage metrics to ensure thorough testing.

## Optional Extensions
*   **Implement a 2-bit branch predictor.**
*   **Add forwarding to reduce data hazards.**
*   **Implement a more sophisticated instruction cache.**
