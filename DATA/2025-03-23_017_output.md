# Task 17: Network-on-Chip (NoC) Router

## 1. Task Description

**Problem Aim:**

This report details the design of a high-performance Network-on-Chip (NoC) router. The router is a fundamental building block in NoC architectures, responsible for efficiently transferring data packets between different processing elements (PEs) within a chip.  This particular implementation focuses on the critical internal component: the router's decision-making logic, specifically a parameterized priority encoder. The router itself is complex, including routing logic, arbitration, buffering, and flow control. This report focuses on the priority encoder aspect of the router's design as it forms the core of many arbitration and selection mechanisms within a router.

**Concise Overview of a Priority Encoder:**

A priority encoder is a combinational logic circuit that identifies the highest priority input signal that is asserted (active high in this case). It outputs the binary representation of the index of the highest priority asserted input. For example, if inputs 0, 2, and 5 are asserted, the priority encoder will output the binary representation of 5 (assuming input 5 has the highest priority).  If no inputs are asserted, it typically outputs a predefined value (e.g., all zeros) and an "enable" signal to indicate that a valid input was present.

**Significance of Parameterization:**

Making the priority encoder parameterized (N-bit) allows the router design to be flexible and scalable. Different NoC implementations may require different numbers of input channels or requestors. A parameterized priority encoder allows the same Verilog code to be instantiated with different input sizes, adapting to the specific requirements of the NoC without requiring code duplication or modification. This promotes reusability, maintainability, and easier integration into various NoC designs.  Furthermore, it facilitates design space exploration, allowing the designer to easily experiment with different configurations to optimize performance and resource utilization.

## 2. Verilog Codes

```verilog
module priority_encoder #(
    parameter N = 4 // Default width of the input
) (
    input  logic [N-1:0] in,   // Input vector
    output logic [clog2(N)-1:0] out,  // Encoded output
    output logic valid           // Indicates if any input is asserted
);

  // Calculate the ceiling of log2(N)
  localparam LOG2_N = (N > 1) ? $clog2(N) : 1;

  always_comb begin
    valid = 1'b0;
    out   = '0;

    for (int i = N - 1; i >= 0; i--) begin
      if (in[i]) begin
        out   = i;
        valid = 1'b1;
        break; // Exit loop as soon as the highest priority is found
      end
    end
  end

  // Function to calculate ceiling of log2. Prevents errors for N = 1 case.
  function integer clog2(input integer depth);
    begin
      clog2 = (depth <= 1) ? 1 : $clog2(depth);
    end
  endfunction

endmodule
```

## 3. Code Explanation

**Module Operation:**

The `priority_encoder` module takes an `N`-bit input vector `in` and outputs a `LOG2_N`-bit encoded output `out` representing the index of the highest priority asserted input. The `valid` output signals whether any input was asserted.

The `always_comb` block iterates through the input vector from the most significant bit (MSB) to the least significant bit (LSB).  When an asserted input is found (`in[i] == 1`), the corresponding index `i` is assigned to the output `out`, the `valid` signal is set to `1`, and the loop is immediately exited using the `break` statement.  This ensures that only the highest priority input's index is encoded.  If no input is asserted, `valid` remains `0` and `out` defaults to all zeros.

**Parameterization:**

The `N` parameter defines the width of the input vector `in`.  The module is parameterized using:

```verilog
parameter N = 4 // Default width of the input
```

The `LOG2_N` localparam calculates the width of the output `out` required to represent the encoded index using the `$clog2` system function. The localparam is defined using:

```verilog
localparam LOG2_N = (N > 1) ? $clog2(N) : 1;
```
The function `clog2` is defined to handle the edge case where `N = 1`. In this scenario, the output requires only 1 bit. This avoids errors that may occur when $clog2(1)$ is evaluated as 0.

**Design Considerations:**

*   **Priority Encoding Direction:** This implementation prioritizes the MSB (highest index) as the highest priority. This can be easily modified by changing the loop direction in the `always_comb` block to iterate from LSB to MSB.
*   **Combinational Logic:** The use of `always_comb` ensures that the output is updated whenever the input changes, making it a combinational circuit. This is typically desired for priority encoders used in arbitration logic within routers.
*   **Handling No Asserted Inputs:** When no input is asserted, the `valid` signal goes low, and the output `out` is set to all zeros.  This behavior is common, but alternative behaviors can be implemented (e.g., outputting a specific "invalid" code).

## 4. Testbench

  logic valid;

  priority_encoder #(
    .N(N)
  ) uut (
    .in(in),
    .out(out),
    .valid(valid)
  );

    if(out != 4'b101 || valid != 1) $error("Test Case 8 Failed");


    $display("Finished Testbench");
    $finish;
  end

endmodule
```

**Testing Methodology:**

The testbench applies various input patterns to the `priority_encoder` module and verifies the correctness of the `out` and `valid` signals. The test cases cover the following scenarios:

*   **No input asserted:** Checks that `valid` is 0 and `out` is all zeros.
*   **Single input asserted (LSB and MSB):** Checks that the correct index is encoded for both the lowest and highest priority inputs.
*   **Multiple inputs asserted:** Checks that the highest priority input is correctly encoded.
*   **Random Input Patterns:** Ensures correct behavior for unpredictable input combinations.
*   **All Inputs High:** Checks functionality when all potential inputs are asserted.

Each test case includes a `$display` statement to show the input and output values, followed by an `$error` statement if the output does not match the expected value.  The delays (`#10`) are used to allow the combinational logic to settle before checking the output.  A clock is provided, but because this design is purely combinational, the clock is not strictly needed.  It is included as a standard practice in simulation environments and can be utilized if additional sequential elements are added in the future.

## 5. Expected Output

The testbench is designed to automatically verify the correctness of the priority encoder. If all tests pass, it will output "Finished Testbench" and terminate without any error messages.

Here's the expected console output if all tests pass (using ModelSim/Questa):

```
Starting Testbench for N=8
Test Case 1: No input asserted
Input:  in = 00000000
Output: out = 0000, valid = 0
Test Case 2: Single input asserted (LSB)
Input:  in = 00000001
Output: out = 0000, valid = 1
Test Case 3: Single input asserted (MSB)
Input:  in = 10000000
Output: out = 0111, valid = 1
Test Case 4: Multiple inputs asserted (MSB and LSB)
Input:  in = 10000001
Output: out = 0111, valid = 1
Test Case 5: Multiple inputs asserted (random)
Input:  in = 01010101
Output: out = 0110, valid = 1
Test Case 6: Only Input 0 asserted
Input:  in = 00000001
Output: out = 0000, valid = 1
Test Case 7: All inputs high
Input:  in = 11111111
Output: out = 0111, valid = 1
Test Case 8: Another Random case
Input:  in = 00110000
Output: out = 0101, valid = 1
Finished Testbench
```

## 6. Notes

**Limitations:**

*   The current implementation prioritizes the highest index. Adapting the priority encoding scheme requires modification of the `always_comb` loop direction.
*   The priority encoder is purely combinational. While suitable for arbitration, it does not inherently address metastability issues that can arise when asynchronous signals are inputs.

**Optimizations:**

*   **Hardware Optimization:** For large values of `N`, the iterative approach in `always_comb` can be optimized using a tree-based implementation to reduce the critical path delay. This involves comparing pairs of inputs in parallel and then cascading the results.
*   **Synthesis Directives:** Synthesis tools can be guided with directives to optimize for speed or area, depending on the specific NoC requirements.

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Metastability Hardening:** If the inputs are asynchronous (coming from different clock domains), metastability resolution logic (e.g., double-flop synchronizers) should be added before the priority encoder to prevent erroneous behavior.
*   **Power Optimization:** The module can be designed to minimize switching activity, especially if it is a critical component in the NoC.  Techniques like clock gating or operand isolation can be considered.

**Best Practices for Verification and Synthesis:**

*   **Comprehensive Testbench:** Create a comprehensive testbench with a wide range of test cases, including corner cases and boundary conditions, to ensure robust verification.
*   **Formal Verification:** For safety-critical applications, consider using formal verification tools to mathematically prove the correctness of the priority encoder's behavior.  Specifically, prove that the highest priority asserted input is always correctly encoded.
*   **Synthesis Constraints:** Use appropriate synthesis constraints (e.g., timing constraints, area constraints) to guide the synthesis tool to meet the performance requirements of the NoC.
*   **Place and Route Verification:** After synthesis and place and route, perform timing simulations to ensure that the design meets the required timing specifications. Check for any timing violations that may compromise the reliability of the NoC.
*   **Gate-Level Simulation:** Perform gate-level simulations with back-annotated timing data to verify the design's behavior after synthesis and place and route.  This is important to identify any timing-related issues that may not be detected in RTL simulations.
*   **Coverage Analysis:** Perform code coverage and functional coverage analysis to identify any untested portions of the Verilog code. Create additional test cases to cover these areas and improve the confidence in the design's correctness.
