# Task 5: AES Encryption/Decryption Core

**Title:** High-Throughput AES-128 Encryption/Decryption

**Objectives:**
Implement a high-throughput AES-128 encryption/decryption core. Minimize latency and maximize throughput while maintaining security.

**Challenges:**
*   Implementing the AES round functions efficiently (SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, AddRoundKey).
*   Optimizing the key expansion algorithm.
*   Pipelining the design to increase throughput.
*   Handling both encryption and decryption modes.
*   Protecting against side-channel attacks (optional).

**Verification Considerations:**
*   Use standard AES test vectors to verify the correctness of the implementation.
*   Perform timing analysis to ensure that the design meets timing requirements.
*   Consider power analysis to assess susceptibility to side-channel attacks (if relevant).
*   Use a cryptographic library for comparison.

**Optional Extensions:**
*   Implement other AES key sizes (192-bit, 256-bit).
*   Add support for different AES modes of operation (CBC, CTR, GCM).
*   Implement countermeasures against side-channel attacks.
