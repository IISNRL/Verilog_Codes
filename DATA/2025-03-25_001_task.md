# RISC-V Core with Branch Prediction

## Objectives
Design a simplified, single-cycle RISC-V core with a basic branch predictor to improve performance. The core should execute a subset of RISC-V instructions (e.g., R-type, I-type, S-type, and a limited set of J-type instructions).  The branch predictor should be a 2-bit saturating counter.

## Challenges
*   **Instruction Fetch & Decode:** Implement a fetch and decode stage to retrieve and interpret instructions.
*   **Execution:** Implement the execution stage to perform arithmetic and logical operations.
*   **Memory Access:** Implement a simple memory access stage for load and store operations.
*   **Branch Prediction:** Implement a 2-bit saturating counter branch predictor.  The predictor should update based on the actual branch outcome.
*   **Control Hazard Handling:**  Handle control hazards caused by mispredicted branches (stall the pipeline).

## Verification Considerations
*   **Testbench:** Create a comprehensive testbench with a variety of RISC-V programs, including branches, loops, and conditional statements.
*   **Waveform Analysis:** Use waveform analysis to verify the correctness of the pipeline stages and the branch predictor's behavior.
*   **Coverage:** Aim for high code coverage and branch coverage in the testbench.

## Optional Extensions
*   **Pipeline Optimization:** Implement a pipelined architecture to increase instruction throughput.
*   **More Sophisticated Branch Predictor:** Implement a more advanced branch predictor (e.g., a two-level predictor).
*   **Cache Simulation:** Simulate a simple cache memory to improve memory access performance.
