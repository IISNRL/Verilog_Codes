# DSP Engine for FIR Filtering

## Objectives
Design a hardware engine for implementing Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filtering. The engine should be configurable for different filter lengths and coefficients.

## Challenges
*   **Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) Unit:** Design an efficient MAC unit for performing the multiplication and accumulation operations.
*   **Coefficient Storage:** Implement a mechanism for storing and accessing the filter coefficients.
*   **Pipelining:** Pipeline the FIR filter to improve throughput.
*   **Configurability:** Design the engine to be configurable for different filter lengths and coefficients.

## Verification Considerations
*   **Testbench:** Create a testbench with various input signals and filter coefficients.
*   **Comparison with Software:** Compare the engine's output with a software reference implementation.
*   **Numerical Accuracy:** Verify the numerical accuracy of the engine's output.

## Optional Extensions
*   **Variable Coefficient Precision:** Support variable coefficient precision to optimize for area and power.
*   **Multiple Filters:** Implement multiple filters in parallel to increase throughput.
*   **Adaptive Filtering:** Implement an adaptive filtering algorithm that adjusts the filter coefficients based on the input signal.
