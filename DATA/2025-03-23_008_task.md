# Task 8: Camera Sensor Interface

**Title:** MIPI CSI-2 Receiver

**Objectives:**
Design a MIPI CSI-2 (Camera Serial Interface 2) receiver to interface with a camera sensor.

**Challenges:**
*   Implementing the MIPI CSI-2 protocol correctly (lane management, clock recovery).
*   Handling different data types and formats.
*   Performing error detection and correction.
*   Managing the timing constraints of the high-speed serial interface.
*   Recovering the image data correctly.

**Verification Considerations:**
*   Use a MIPI CSI-2 transmitter model to simulate the camera sensor.
*   Verify the data integrity by comparing the received image data with the transmitted data.
*   Use assertions to check protocol adherence.
*   Perform timing analysis to ensure that the design meets timing requirements.

**Optional Extensions:**
*   Add support for different MIPI CSI-2 data types.
*   Implement image processing algorithms (e.g., color correction, noise reduction).
*   Optimize the receiver for low power consumption.
