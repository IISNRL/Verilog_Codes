# Task 6: Ethernet MAC Controller

**Title:** Gigabit Ethernet MAC Controller

**Objectives:**
Design a Gigabit Ethernet MAC (Media Access Control) controller that supports frame transmission and reception.

**Challenges:**
*   Implementing the Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) protocol.
*   Handling preamble and start-of-frame delimiter (SFD) detection.
*   Calculating and verifying the frame check sequence (FCS).
*   Managing MAC address filtering.
*   Dealing with interframe gap (IFG) and backoff algorithms.

**Verification Considerations:**
*   Use a network analyzer to verify the transmitted and received frames.
*   Implement a testbench that simulates various network scenarios, including collisions and congestion.
*   Use assertions to check protocol adherence.
*   Compare the performance with standard network traffic generators.

**Optional Extensions:**
*   Add support for VLAN tagging.
*   Implement quality of service (QoS) mechanisms.
*   Optimize the controller for low power consumption.
