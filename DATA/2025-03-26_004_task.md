# High-Speed Memory Controller (DDR5)

## Objectives
Design a simplified DDR5 memory controller capable of handling basic read and write operations. Focus on timing and synchronization.

## Challenges
*   **DDR5 Protocol:** Implement the core aspects of the DDR5 protocol, including address decoding, data masking, and command sequencing.
*   **Timing Synchronization:** Handle the complex timing requirements of DDR5, including precharge, activate, read, and write cycles.
*   **Burst Mode:** Implement burst mode operations for efficient data transfer.
*   **Error Correction:** Implement a basic error correction mechanism (e.g., single-bit ECC).

## Verification Considerations
*   **Timing Simulation:** Perform extensive timing simulation to verify that the controller meets timing requirements.
*   **Protocol Compliance:** Verify compliance with the DDR5 specification.
*   **Stress Testing:** Subject the controller to stress testing to identify potential weaknesses.

## Optional Extensions
*   **Implement a more sophisticated error correction mechanism (e.g., double-bit ECC).**
*   **Implement a dynamic frequency scaling (DFS) mechanism.**
*   **Optimize for power consumption by implementing clock gating.**
