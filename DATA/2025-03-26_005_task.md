# DSP Engine for FIR Filtering

## Objectives
Design a DSP engine capable of performing Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filtering. The engine should be optimized for both speed and resource utilization.

## Challenges
*   **Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) Unit:** Design an efficient MAC unit for performing the core filtering calculations.
*   **Shift Register:** Implement a shift register to store the filter coefficients and input samples.
*   **Pipelining:** Pipeline the filtering process to maximize throughput.
*   **Coefficient Loading:** Design a mechanism for loading the filter coefficients into the shift register.

## Verification Considerations
*   **Test Signals:** Use a variety of test signals to verify the accuracy of the filtering process.
*   **Frequency Response Analysis:** Analyze the frequency response of the filter to ensure that it meets specifications.
*   **Numerical Precision:** Consider the impact of numerical precision on the accuracy of the filtering process.

## Optional Extensions
*   **Implement a variable coefficient filter.**
*   **Optimize for area by sharing resources between different filter stages.**
*   **Implement a hardware-based coefficient update mechanism.
