# Network-on-Chip (NoC) Router

## Objectives
Design a 2D mesh NoC router with a wormhole routing algorithm. The router should support multiple virtual channels to prevent deadlock and livelock.

## Challenges
*   **Wormhole Routing:** Implement the wormhole routing algorithm, including header and tail tracking.
*   **Virtual Channels:** Implement multiple virtual channels to prevent deadlock and livelock.
*   **Flow Control:** Implement a credit-based flow control mechanism.
*   **Arbitration:** Design an arbitration scheme to resolve conflicts between multiple packets.

## Verification Considerations
*   **Packet Injection:** Develop a testbench that injects packets with varying priorities and destinations.
*   **Deadlock/Livelock Detection:** Implement mechanisms to detect and prevent deadlock and livelock.
*   **Throughput Measurement:** Measure the throughput of the NoC under different traffic patterns.

## Optional Extensions
*   **Implement adaptive routing to avoid congested links.**
*   **Implement a quality-of-service (QoS) mechanism.**
*   **Explore different routing algorithms (e.g., XY routing).**
