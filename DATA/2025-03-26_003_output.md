# Network-on-Chip (NoC) Router Design Report

## 1. Task Description

**Aim:** This project aims to design a 2D mesh Network-on-Chip (NoC) router utilizing a wormhole routing algorithm with multiple virtual channels for deadlock and livelock prevention. The router acts as a communication node within a larger NoC architecture, facilitating data transfer between different processing elements.

**Overview:** The NoC router receives packets from neighboring routers, determines the next hop based on the destination address, and forwards the packet.  The wormhole routing approach divides the packet into small, manageable flits (flow control units) and transmits them sequentially.  Multiple virtual channels allow multiple packets to traverse the network concurrently, reducing contention and improving performance.

**Significance:**  NoCs are increasingly vital in modern multi-core systems and System-on-Chips (SoCs) due to their scalability and efficiency compared to traditional bus-based architectures. Wormhole routing minimizes latency by transmitting flits as soon as they are available. Virtual channels are crucial for avoiding deadlock and livelock, which are common problems in NoC designs.

## Explanation:

1.  **Module Declaration:**
    *   `module router`: Defines the router module.
    *   `input logic [ADDR_WIDTH-1:0] dest_addr`: Input destination address.
    *   `output logic [FLIT_WIDTH-1:0] flit_out_north, flit_out_south, flit_out_east, flit_out_west`: Outputs flits to neighboring routers.
    *   `output logic flit_out_north_valid, flit_out_south_valid, flit_out_east_valid, flit_out_west_valid`:  Valid signals for the output flits.

2.  **Internal Signals:**
    *   `routing_table`:  A table to store the routing decisions for each virtual channel.
    *   `buffer_north`, `buffer_east`, `buffer_south`, `buffer_west`: Buffers to hold flits before forwarding.
    *   `buffer_north_valid`, `buffer_east_valid`, `buffer_south_valid`, `buffer_west_valid`:  Valid signals for the buffers.
    *   `header_present`, `tail_present`: Flags to indicate the presence of a header and tail flit.
    *   `current_vc`: The currently selected virtual channel.

3.  **Routing Logic:**
    *   `routing_logic`: A function that calculates the next hop based on the destination address and virtual channel.  This is a simplified XY routing example.  In a real router, this would be more complex.

4.  **Buffer Logic:**
    *   The buffer logic is simplified.  In a real router, this would include flow control mechanisms to prevent buffer overflow and ensure fair bandwidth allocation.

5.  **Output Logic:**
    *   The output logic assigns the flit from the selected virtual channel's buffer to the corresponding output port.

## Key Improvements and Considerations:

*   **Virtual Channels:** The code now includes virtual channels to improve throughput and reduce deadlock potential.
*   **Routing Table:** A routing table is used to determine the next hop for each virtual channel.
*   **Buffering:** Buffers are used to store flits before forwarding.
*   **Simplified Routing:** The routing logic is simplified for demonstration purposes.  A real router would use a more sophisticated routing algorithm.
*   **Flow Control:** The buffer logic is simplified and does not include flow control.  Flow control is essential for preventing buffer overflow and ensuring fair bandwidth allocation.
*   **Deadlock Prevention:**  The use of virtual channels helps to prevent deadlock, but other techniques may also be necessary.
*   **Simulation:**  This code is intended for simulation and may need to be modified for synthesis.

This improved version provides a more complete and realistic representation of a router.  However, it is still a simplified model and does not include all of the features of a real router.
