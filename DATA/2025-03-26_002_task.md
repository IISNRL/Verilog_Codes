# AES-GCM Accelerator

## Objectives
Design a hardware accelerator for the AES-GCM (Advanced Encryption Standard - Galois/Counter Mode) encryption/decryption algorithm. The accelerator should be optimized for throughput and latency.

## Challenges
*   **AES Implementation:** Implement the AES round function in hardware, including S-box lookup and MixColumns transformation.
*   **Galois/Counter Mode:** Implement the GCM mode, including the generation of the authentication tag.
*   **Pipelining:** Pipeline the AES rounds and GCM operations to maximize throughput.
*   **Parallelism:** Explore opportunities for parallel execution of AES rounds and GCM operations.

## Verification Considerations
*   **Test Vectors:** Use standard AES-GCM test vectors to verify correctness.
*   **Timing Analysis:** Perform timing analysis to ensure that the accelerator meets performance requirements.
*   **Security Analysis:** Consider potential security vulnerabilities and implement countermeasures.

## Optional Extensions
*   **Implement a hardware-based S-box lookup table generator.**
*   **Optimize for area by sharing resources between encryption and decryption.**
*   **Implement a hardware-based counter for GCM mode.**
