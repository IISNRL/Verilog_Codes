# RISC-V Core with Branch Prediction

## 1. Task Description

This project aims to design a simplified, single-cycle RISC-V core with a basic branch predictor. The core will execute a subset of RISC-V instructions, including R-type (e.g., `add`, `sub`), I-type (e.g., `addi`, `lw`), S-type (e.g., `sw`), and a limited set of J-type instructions (e.g., `jal`).  The inclusion of a 1-bit branch predictor aims to mitigate pipeline stalls caused by mispredicted branches, improving overall performance.  The design utilizes a 2-stage pipeline: Instruction Fetch and Execute.  This design approach is significant because it provides a foundational understanding of RISC-V architecture, pipeline design, and the crucial role of branch prediction in modern processors.  It allows for a manageable complexity while demonstrating core concepts.

## 3. Code Explanation

The `riscv_core` module implements a simplified RISC-V core with a 1-bit branch predictor.

*   **Parameters and Signals:** Defines the state machine states (IDLE, FETCH, EXECUTE) and internal signals for instruction fetching, register data, immediate values, ALU operation, and branch history.
*   **Register File:** A 32x32 register file is implemented using `reg [31:0] register_file [0:31]`.
*   **Branch Predictor:** A single bit `branch_prediction` stores the prediction. `branch_history` stores the last branch prediction.
*   **State Machine:** The core operates in a state machine with three states:
    *   **IDLE:** Initializes the program counter.
    *   **FETCH:** Fetches the next instruction.
    *   **EXECUTE:** Decodes and executes the instruction.
*   **Instruction Decoding:** The `case` statement decodes the instruction based on the opcode.  Currently supports ADD, ADDI, LW, SW, and JAL.
*   **ALU Operation:** The `alu_op` signal determines the ALU operation.
*   **Immediate Generation:**  Sign-extension is performed when generating the immediate value.
*   **Branch Prediction:** The `branch_prediction` signal is used to predict the next branch. The `branch_history` is updated with the last branch prediction.

## 4. Branch Predictor

The branch predictor is a simple 1-bit predictor. It always predicts the same way as the last branch taken.

## 5. Limitations

*   **Limited Instruction Set:** Only a few instructions are supported.
*   **No Data Hazards:** No mechanisms are implemented to handle data hazards.
*   **Simple Branch Prediction:** The branch predictor is very basic and prone to errors.
*   **No Memory:** No memory interface is implemented.
*   **No Control Hazards:** No mechanisms are implemented to handle control hazards.

## 6. Testbench (Example)

```verilog
module riscv_core_tb;

  riscv_core uut (
    .clk(clk),
    .rst(rst)
  );

  reg clk;
  reg rst;

  initial begin
    clk = 0;
    rst = 1;
    #10 rst = 0;
    #100 $finish;
  end

  always #5 clk = ~clk;

endmodule
```

This testbench provides a clock and reset signal to the `riscv_core` module.  More comprehensive testbenches would be needed to thoroughly test the functionality of the core.
