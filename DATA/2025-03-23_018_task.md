# Task 18: Beamforming Engine

**Title:** Digital Beamforming Engine for Wireless Communications

**Objectives:**
Design a digital beamforming engine for wireless communications applications.

**Challenges:**
*   Implementing complex multiplication and addition operations efficiently.
*   Managing data movement between memory and processing elements.
*   Optimizing the engine for throughput and power consumption.
*   Handling different antenna array configurations.
*   Performing calibration to compensate for antenna imperfections.

**Verification Considerations:**
*   Use a wireless channel simulator to generate test vectors.
*   Compare the engine's output with the output of a reference beamforming algorithm.
*   Analyze the beam pattern generated by the engine.
*   Verify the engine's ability to handle different channel conditions.

**Optional Extensions:**
*   Add support for adaptive beamforming algorithms.
*   Implement interference cancellation techniques.
*   Optimize the engine for low power consumption.
