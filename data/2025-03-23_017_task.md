# Task 17: Network-on-Chip (NoC) Router

**Title:** High-Performance NoC Router

**Objectives:**
Design a high-performance router for a Network-on-Chip (NoC) architecture.

**Challenges:**
*   Implementing routing algorithms to determine the optimal path for packets.
*   Arbitrating between multiple input ports competing for the same output port.
*   Buffering packets to handle congestion.
*   Managing flow control to prevent buffer overflow.
*   Optimizing the router for throughput and latency.

**Verification Considerations:**
*   Use a NoC simulator to test the performance of the router.
*   Verify the router's ability to handle different traffic patterns.
*   Analyze the router's latency and throughput under different load conditions.
*   Use formal verification to prove the correctness of the routing algorithm.

**Optional Extensions:**
*   Add support for quality of service (QoS) mechanisms.
*   Implement adaptive routing algorithms.
*   Optimize the router for low power consumption.
