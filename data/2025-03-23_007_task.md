# Task 7: FFT/IFFT Processor

**Title:** Radix-2 FFT/IFFT Processor

**Objectives:**
Design a Radix-2 Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) processor.

**Challenges:**
*   Implementing the butterfly computation efficiently.
*   Managing twiddle factors correctly.
*   Optimizing the memory access patterns.
*   Handling complex number arithmetic.
*   Choosing an appropriate architecture (pipelined, memory-based).

**Verification Considerations:**
*   Use standard FFT/IFFT test vectors to verify the correctness of the implementation.
*   Compare the output with a reference FFT/IFFT library (e.g., from MATLAB).
*   Analyze the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the output.
*   Verify the accuracy of the complex number arithmetic.

**Optional Extensions:**
*   Implement other FFT algorithms (e.g., Radix-4, split-radix).
*   Add support for different transform sizes.
*   Optimize the processor for low power consumption.
