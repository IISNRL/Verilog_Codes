# Task 2: Advanced Memory Controller

**Title:** DDR4 Memory Controller

**Objectives:**
Design a DDR4 memory controller capable of handling burst reads and writes. The controller should implement refresh and power-down modes.

**Challenges:**
*   Implementing the DDR4 protocol correctly (command encoding, timing constraints).
*   Handling refresh requests and scheduling them efficiently.
*   Managing memory banks and ranks to maximize bandwidth.
*   Implementing arbitration logic for multiple memory requests.
*   Meeting stringent timing constraints defined by the DDR4 standard.

**Verification Considerations:**
*   Use a DDR4 memory model to simulate the memory interface.
*   Verify the timing compliance using static timing analysis (STA).
*   Implement a testbench that covers various read/write scenarios, including burst transfers and refresh cycles.
*   Use assertions to check protocol adherence.

**Optional Extensions:**
*   Implement a transaction queuing mechanism for improved performance.
*   Add support for error detection and correction (ECC).
*   Optimize the controller for low power consumption.
