# Task 16: Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) Hardware Support

**Title:** Hardware Task Scheduler for RTOS

**Objectives:**
Design a hardware task scheduler to accelerate task switching in a real-time operating system (RTOS).

**Challenges:**
*   Managing task priorities and scheduling policies.
*   Handling interrupts and context switching.
*   Implementing a timer to trigger periodic task execution.
*   Protecting against priority inversion.
*   Ensuring determinism and predictability.

**Verification Considerations:**
*   Use a real-time operating system (e.g., FreeRTOS, Zephyr) to test the scheduler.
*   Verify the scheduler's ability to meet deadlines.
*   Analyze the worst-case execution time (WCET) of tasks.
*   Use formal verification to prove the correctness of the scheduler.

**Optional Extensions:**
*   Add support for hardware semaphores and mutexes.
*   Implement a hardware watchdog timer.
*   Optimize the scheduler for low power consumption.
