# Task 1: High-Performance Floating-Point Multiplier

**Title:** IEEE 754 Single-Precision Floating-Point Multiplier

**Objectives:**
Implement a high-performance, fully compliant IEEE 754 single-precision floating-point multiplier. Maximize throughput and minimize latency.

**Challenges:**
*   Handling special cases: NaN, Infinity, Zero, Denormalized numbers.
*   Efficient normalization and rounding (rounding modes: round to nearest even).
*   Optimizing the multiplier core for speed and area.
*   Pipelining the design to increase throughput.

**Verification Considerations:**
*   Create a testbench that covers all IEEE 754 test vectors for multiplication.
*   Use directed tests for special cases.
*   Implement coverage metrics to ensure complete test coverage.
*   Compare the output with a reference floating-point multiplier (e.g., from a standard library).

**Optional Extensions:**
*   Implement other rounding modes (round up, round down, round to zero).
*   Add support for double-precision floating-point multiplication.
*   Optimize the design for low power consumption.
