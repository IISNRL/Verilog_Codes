# Task 14: Secure Element

**Title:** Secure Element for IoT Devices

**Objectives:**
Design a secure element for IoT devices that provides secure storage for cryptographic keys and performs cryptographic operations.

**Challenges:**
*   Implementing cryptographic algorithms (e.g., RSA, ECC) securely.
*   Protecting against physical attacks (e.g., side-channel attacks, fault injection attacks).
*   Managing access control and authentication.
*   Storing cryptographic keys in a tamper-resistant memory.
*   Generating random numbers securely.

**Verification Considerations:**
*   Use a hardware security emulator to simulate attacks on the element.
*   Verify the security properties of the cryptographic algorithms using formal verification.
*   Analyze the element's resistance to physical attacks.
*   Certify the element according to industry standards (e.g., Common Criteria).

**Optional Extensions:**
*   Add support for secure boot and remote attestation.
*   Implement secure over-the-air (OTA) updates.
*   Optimize the element for low power consumption.
