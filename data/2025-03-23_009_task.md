# Task 9: Neural Network Accelerator

**Title:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Accelerator

**Objectives:**
Design an accelerator for convolutional neural networks (CNNs), focusing on convolution layers. Optimize for throughput and energy efficiency.

**Challenges:**
*   Implementing the convolution operation efficiently.
*   Managing data movement between memory and processing elements.
*   Optimizing the memory access patterns to reduce latency.
*   Implementing parallel processing to increase throughput.
*   Supporting different CNN layer configurations (kernel size, stride, padding).

**Verification Considerations:**
*   Use a CNN framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) to generate test vectors.
*   Compare the accelerator's output with the output of the CNN framework.
*   Analyze the performance of the accelerator in terms of throughput and energy efficiency.
*   Verify the correctness of the convolution operation.

**Optional Extensions:**
*   Add support for other CNN layers (e.g., pooling, fully connected).
*   Implement quantization techniques to reduce memory bandwidth.
*   Optimize the accelerator for low power consumption.
