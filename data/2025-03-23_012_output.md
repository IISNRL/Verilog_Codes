# Task 12: High-Dynamic-Range (HDR) Image Processing Pipeline

## 1. Task Description

**Problem Aim:** The aim of this task is to design and implement an image processing pipeline to enhance High Dynamic Range (HDR) images.  HDR images capture a wider range of luminance values than standard dynamic range (SDR) images, allowing for more realistic representation of scenes with extreme contrast. However, these images need to be processed for display on devices with limited dynamic range, and this is the core of the task. The processing pipeline focuses on compressing the dynamic range using tone mapping, reducing noise, and enhancing details to create visually appealing images while preserving the HDR information as much as possible.

**Concise Overview of Priority Encoder:** A priority encoder is a digital circuit that accepts multiple input signals and outputs a binary code corresponding to the highest priority (typically the leftmost, or highest-indexed) asserted input signal. If multiple inputs are asserted simultaneously, the encoder only outputs the code for the input with the highest priority.  It also typically provides a "valid" output to indicate that at least one input is asserted.

**Significance of Parameterization:** Making the priority encoder parameterized allows it to be easily adapted to different input bit-widths (N). This is crucial for HDR image processing because different image formats and processing stages might require different levels of precision and dynamic range representation. A parameterized design avoids redundant code and promotes reusability. Furthermore, synthesis tools can optimize the encoder based on the specific value of N, potentially leading to more efficient hardware implementations.

## 2. Verilog Codes

```verilog
module priority_encoder #(
  parameter WIDTH = 8 // Default width of the input vector
) (
  input  logic [WIDTH-1:0] in,    // Input vector
  output logic [$clog2(WIDTH)-1:0] out,   // Output encoded value
  output logic valid                // Indicates if any input is asserted
);

  // Check if the specified width is valid
  initial begin
    if (WIDTH <= 0) begin
      $error("Error: WIDTH must be greater than 0.");
      $finish;
    end
  end


  logic [WIDTH-1:0] temp;

  always_comb begin
    valid = |in; // Check if any input is high

    if (!valid) begin
      out = 0; // Default output if no input is asserted (could also be 'x')
    end else begin
      temp = in;
      for (int i = WIDTH-1; i >= 0; i--) begin
        if (temp[i]) begin
          out = i;
          break; // Exit after finding the highest priority asserted input
        end
      end
    end
  end

endmodule
```

## 3. Code Explanation

The `priority_encoder` module takes an `in` input vector of `WIDTH` bits and produces an `out` output, which is the binary encoding of the highest priority asserted input.  It also produces a `valid` output, which indicates whether any input is asserted.

**Logic Flow:**

1.  **Parameterization:** The module is parameterized using the `parameter WIDTH` declaration. This allows the user to specify the width of the input vector. The `WIDTH` parameter has a default value of 8.

2.  **Valid Signal:** The `valid` output is asserted if any of the inputs in the `in` vector are high. This is achieved using the reduction OR operator (`|in`).

3.  **Encoding Logic:** The `always_comb` block contains the encoding logic. It iterates from the most significant bit (MSB) to the least significant bit (LSB) of the `in` vector. If an input bit is asserted (`in[i] == 1`), the corresponding index `i` is assigned to the `out` output, and the loop is terminated using `break`. This ensures that only the highest priority asserted input is encoded.

4. **Error Checking:** An initial block checks if the provided WIDTH parameter is a valid one. If not, it throws an error to inform the user and ends the simulation.

**Parameterization Details:**

*   The `WIDTH` parameter controls the size of the input vector.
*   The output `out`'s width is automatically calculated using `$clog2(WIDTH)`, ensuring it has enough bits to represent all possible input indices.
*   The `always_comb` block ensures that the output is updated whenever the input changes, making the module combinational.

**Design Considerations:**

*   **Default Output:** When no input is asserted (`valid == 0`), the output is set to 0. This can be changed to `'x'` (unknown) if desired.
*   **Performance:** For very large values of `WIDTH`, the iterative approach in the `always_comb` block might become a performance bottleneck. In such cases, more optimized approaches like tree-based encoders might be considered.
*   **Synthesis:** Synthesis tools can optimize the encoder based on the specific value of `WIDTH`, potentially leading to more efficient hardware implementations.

## 4. Testbench

```verilog
module priority_encoder_tb;

  parameter WIDTH = 8;

  logic [WIDTH-1:0] test_in;
  logic [$clog2(WIDTH)-1:0] test_out;
  logic test_valid;

  priority_encoder #(
    .WIDTH(WIDTH)
  ) dut (
    .in(test_in),
    .out(test_out),
    .valid(test_valid)
  );

  initial begin
    // Test Case 1: No input asserted
    test_in = 0;
    #10;
    $display("Test Case 1: in=%b, out=%d, valid=%b", test_in, test_out, test_valid);
    assert (test_out == 0 && test_valid == 0) else $error("Test Case 1 Failed!");

    // Test Case 2: Single input asserted (MSB)
    test_in = (1 << (WIDTH-1));
    #10;
    $display("Test Case 2: in=%b, out=%d, valid=%b", test_in, test_out, test_valid);
    assert (test_out == WIDTH-1 && test_valid == 1) else $error("Test Case 2 Failed!");

    // Test Case 3: Single input asserted (LSB)
    test_in = 1;
    #10;
    $display("Test Case 3: in=%b, out=%d, valid=%b", test_in, test_out, test_valid);
    assert (test_out == 0 && test_valid == 1) else $error("Test Case 3 Failed!");

    // Test Case 4: Multiple inputs asserted (MSB has priority)
    test_in = (1 << (WIDTH-1)) | 1;
    #10;
    $display("Test Case 4: in=%b, out=%d, valid=%b", test_in, test_out, test_valid);
    assert (test_out == WIDTH-1 && test_valid == 1) else $error("Test Case 4 Failed!");

    // Test Case 5: Multiple inputs asserted (Middle has priority)
    test_in = (1 << (WIDTH/2)) | 1;
    #10;
    $display("Test Case 5: in=%b, out=%d, valid=%b", test_in, test_out, test_valid);
    assert (test_out == WIDTH/2 && test_valid == 1) else $error("Test Case 5 Failed!");

     // Test Case 6: All inputs asserted
    test_in = ~0;
    #10;
    $display("Test Case 6: in=%b, out=%d, valid=%b", test_in, test_out, test_valid);
    assert (test_out == WIDTH-1 && test_valid == 1) else $error("Test Case 6 Failed!");

    $finish;
  end

endmodule
```

**Testing Methodology:**

The testbench covers the following critical conditions:

*   **No Input Asserted:** Verifies that the `valid` output is low and the `out` output is 0 when no input is asserted.
*   **Single Input Asserted (MSB):** Verifies that the `out` output correctly encodes the MSB when it is the only asserted input.
*   **Single Input Asserted (LSB):** Verifies that the `out` output correctly encodes the LSB when it is the only asserted input.
*   **Multiple Inputs Asserted (MSB has priority):** Verifies that the `out` output correctly encodes the MSB when multiple inputs are asserted.
*   **Multiple Inputs Asserted (Middle has priority):** Tests that the encoding works correctly for a middle input.
*   **All inputs asserted:** Tests the case when every input bit is a '1'.

Each test case assigns a specific input pattern to `test_in`, waits for a short delay (`#10`), and then checks if the `test_out` and `test_valid` outputs match the expected values using `assert` statements.  Error messages are displayed if any assertion fails.

## 5. Expected Output

The expected output from the testbench is as follows:

```
Test Case 1: in=00000000, out=0, valid=0
Test Case 2: in=10000000, out=7, valid=1
Test Case 3: in=00000001, out=0, valid=1
Test Case 4: in=10000001, out=7, valid=1
Test Case 5: in=00010001, out=4, valid=1
Test Case 6: in=11111111, out=7, valid=1
```

Each line corresponds to a test case, showing the input (`in`), output (`out`), and valid (`valid`) signals.  The testbench should complete without any assertion errors.

## 6. Notes

*   **Limitations:** The current implementation uses an iterative approach, which might be slow for very large values of `WIDTH`. Consider using a tree-based encoder for better performance in such cases.
*   **Optimizations:**  For synthesis, the tool will likely optimize the logic based on the specific value of `WIDTH`.
*   **Potential Enhancements:**  The module could be extended to support different priority schemes (e.g., LSB having higher priority) by modifying the iteration direction in the `always_comb` block.
*   **Verification Best Practices:**
    *   **Formal Verification:** Consider using formal verification tools to prove the correctness of the design, especially for larger values of `WIDTH`.
    *   **Corner Case Testing:**  Thoroughly test edge cases, such as all inputs asserted, no inputs asserted, and only one input asserted at different positions.
    *   **Code Coverage:** Use code coverage tools to ensure that all lines of code in the module are executed during testing.
*   **Synthesis Best Practices:**
    *   **Specify Timing Constraints:** Provide appropriate timing constraints to the synthesis tool to ensure that the encoder meets the required performance.
    *   **Area Optimization:** If area is a concern, instruct the synthesis tool to prioritize area optimization.
