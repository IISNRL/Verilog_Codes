# Task 13: Multi-Core Processor System

**Title:** Cache-Coherent Multi-Core Processor

**Objectives:**
Design a cache-coherent multi-core processor system with a shared memory space.

**Challenges:**
*   Implementing a cache coherence protocol (e.g., MESI) to ensure data consistency across multiple cores.
*   Managing memory access conflicts between multiple cores.
*   Optimizing the cache hierarchy for performance.
*   Handling inter-processor communication.
*   Ensuring fairness and preventing starvation.

**Verification Considerations:**
*   Use a multi-threaded benchmark to test the performance of the system.
*   Verify the cache coherence protocol using formal verification or simulation.
*   Analyze the memory access patterns of different applications.
*   Verify the system's ability to handle concurrent access to shared data.

**Optional Extensions:**
*   Add support for heterogeneous cores.
*   Implement a hardware transactional memory system.
*   Optimize the system for low power consumption.
