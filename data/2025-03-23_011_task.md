# Task 11: PCIe Endpoint Controller

**Title:** PCIe Gen3 Endpoint Controller

**Objectives:**
Design a PCIe Gen3 endpoint controller that can transfer data to and from a host system.

**Challenges:**
*   Implementing the PCIe protocol correctly (transaction layer, data link layer, physical layer).
*   Handling different transaction types (memory read, memory write, configuration read, configuration write).
*   Managing DMA transfers between the endpoint and the host system.
*   Meeting the stringent timing constraints of the PCIe Gen3 interface.
*   Ensuring interoperability with different host systems.

**Verification Considerations:**
*   Use a PCIe protocol analyzer to verify the transmitted and received packets.
*   Implement a testbench that simulates various PCIe traffic scenarios.
*   Use assertions to check protocol adherence.
*   Verify the performance of the endpoint controller in terms of throughput and latency.

**Optional Extensions:**
*   Add support for PCIe Gen4 or Gen5.
*   Implement virtualization support (SR-IOV).
*   Optimize the controller for low power consumption.
