# Task 19: H.264/H.265 Decoder

**Title:** H.264/H.265 Video Decoder Core

**Objectives:**
Implement a hardware H.264 or H.265 video decoder core. Optimize for decoding speed, power efficiency, and error resilience.

**Challenges:**
*   Implementing the various decoding stages: entropy decoding, inverse transform, deblocking filter, and motion compensation.
*   Managing complex data dependencies between decoding stages.
*   Handling different profiles and levels of the H.264/H.265 standards.
*   Dealing with error concealment techniques.
*   Optimizing the core for parallel processing and pipelining.

**Verification Considerations:**
*   Use standard H.264/H.265 test streams to verify the correctness of the decoding process.
*   Compare the decoded video with a reference decoder implementation.
*   Measure the decoding speed (frames per second) and power consumption.
*   Simulate error scenarios to test the error resilience of the decoder.

**Optional Extensions:**
*   Add support for higher resolutions and frame rates.
*   Implement advanced error concealment techniques.
*   Optimize the core for low power consumption.
