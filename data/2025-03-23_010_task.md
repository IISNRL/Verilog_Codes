# Task 10: Hardware Security Module (HSM)

**Title:** Secure Boot Module

**Objectives:**
Design a secure boot module that verifies the integrity of the bootloader and operating system before execution.

**Challenges:**
*   Implementing cryptographic hash functions (e.g., SHA-256) to verify the integrity of the software.
*   Managing secure storage for cryptographic keys and certificates.
*   Protecting against tampering and replay attacks.
*   Implementing a secure boot process that cannot be bypassed.
*   Ensuring confidentiality of sensitive data.

**Verification Considerations:**
*   Use a hardware security emulator to simulate attacks on the module.
*   Verify the integrity of the bootloader and operating system after different types of attacks.
*   Use formal verification to prove the security properties of the module.
*   Analyze the module's resistance to physical attacks.

**Optional Extensions:**
*   Add support for remote attestation to verify the module's identity and configuration.
*   Implement secure key management techniques.
*   Optimize the module for low power consumption.
