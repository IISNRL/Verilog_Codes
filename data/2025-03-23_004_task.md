# Task 4: RISC-V Processor Core

**Title:** Pipelined RISC-V Processor

**Objectives:**
Design a 5-stage pipelined RISC-V processor core implementing the RV32I instruction set. Optimize for instruction per cycle (IPC).

**Challenges:**
*   Handling data hazards (RAW, WAR, WAW) using forwarding and stalling.
*   Handling control hazards (branch instructions) using branch prediction.
*   Implementing the instruction decode and execute logic.
*   Designing the register file and memory interface.
*   Ensuring correct program execution.

**Verification Considerations:**
*   Use a RISC-V ISA simulator to compare the processor's output with the expected results.
*   Implement a testbench that covers all RV32I instructions and hazard scenarios.
*   Use formal verification to prove the correctness of the pipeline.
*   Use a RISC-V compliance test suite.

**Optional Extensions:**
*   Add support for compressed instructions (RV32C).
*   Implement a branch target buffer (BTB) for improved branch prediction.
*   Add support for floating-point instructions (RV32F).
