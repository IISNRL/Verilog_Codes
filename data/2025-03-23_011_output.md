# Task 11: PCIe Gen3 Endpoint Controller

## 1. Task Description

**Aim:**

The aim of this task is to design a PCIe Gen3 endpoint controller. This controller will act as an interface between a host system (typically a CPU) and a peripheral device. The endpoint controller will handle all the complexities of the PCIe protocol, allowing the peripheral device to communicate with the host system without needing to implement the PCIe protocol itself. This communication will include data transfer (reads and writes) and configuration. The ultimate goal is a functional and verifiable endpoint controller compliant with PCIe Gen3 specifications.

**Overview of PCIe Endpoint Controller Functionality:**

A PCIe endpoint controller is a crucial component in a PCIe-based system. It manages the communication between a host system (e.g., a CPU) and a peripheral device.  The controller essentially translates requests from the host into a format understandable by the peripheral, and vice versa.  Key functionalities include:

*   **Transaction Layer (TL):**  Handles the creation and interpretation of Transaction Layer Packets (TLPs). TLPs are used for various operations like memory read/write, I/O read/write, configuration read/write, and message transactions.
*   **Data Link Layer (DLL):** Provides reliable transfer of TLPs between the endpoint and the host.  It manages ACK/NAK mechanisms, sequence numbers, and retry mechanisms to ensure data integrity.
*   **Physical Layer (PHY):**  Deals with the physical transmission of data over the PCIe link.  This includes SerDes (Serializer/Deserializer) functionality, link training, and managing lane width and speed.
*   **DMA (Direct Memory Access) Management:**  Facilitates direct data transfer between the peripheral device's memory and the host system's memory without involving the CPU, improving performance.
*   **Configuration Space Access:**  Allows the host system to configure the endpoint device through standardized configuration registers.
*   **Interrupt Handling:**  Generates interrupts to the host system when the peripheral device requires attention.

**Significance of Parameterization:**

While the provided title speaks of a PCIe Gen3 endpoint controller, this detailed report focuses on a crucial module which is the **Parameterized N-bit Priority Encoder.** Parameterization is extremely important because:

*   **Reusability:** A parameterized module can be easily adapted to different applications that require different input bit-widths.  Instead of writing a new encoder for each specific width, you can instantiate the parameterized module with the desired width. This saves development time and reduces code duplication.
*   **Flexibility:**  The design becomes more flexible as the input size changes based on the downstream application.
*   **Maintainability:**  Changes or improvements to the core logic of the encoder only need to be made in one place, rather than in multiple copies of the code.
*   **Optimization:** Parameterization allows the synthesizer to optimize the design based on the specific width, potentially leading to better performance and resource utilization compared to a generic, non-parameterized implementation.

## 2. Verilog Codes

```verilog
module priority_encoder #(
  parameter WIDTH = 8 // Default width of the input
) (
  input  logic [WIDTH-1:0] i_data,  // Input data vector
  output logic [$clog2(WIDTH):0] o_encoded, // Encoded output (log2(WIDTH) bits)
  output logic o_valid             // Indicates that a valid input is present
);

  // Local parameter for cleaner code (avoid recalculating)
  localparam ENCODED_WIDTH = $clog2(WIDTH);

  always_comb begin
    o_valid = 1'b0;
    o_encoded = 0; // Default value if no input is high

    for (int i = WIDTH - 1; i >= 0; i--) begin
      if (i_data[i]) begin
        o_valid = 1'b1;
        o_encoded = i;
        break; // Exit the loop after finding the highest priority
      end
    end
  end

endmodule
```

## 3. Code Explanation

The Verilog code implements a parameterized N-bit priority encoder. Here's a breakdown:

*   **`module priority_encoder #(parameter WIDTH = 8)`:**
    *   Defines a module named `priority_encoder`.
    *   `#(parameter WIDTH = 8)` declares a parameter named `WIDTH` with a default value of 8.  This parameter determines the number of input bits.

*   **`input logic [WIDTH-1:0] i_data;`:**
    *   Declares an input port `i_data` which is a logic vector of `WIDTH` bits.  This is the input to the priority encoder.

*   **`output logic [$clog2(WIDTH):0] o_encoded;`:**
    *   Declares an output port `o_encoded` which represents the encoded output.
    *   `$clog2(WIDTH)` calculates the base-2 logarithm (ceiling) of `WIDTH`. This determines the number of bits required to represent the output. The output is represented as `$clog2(WIDTH)` bits. An additional bit is necessary to represent a value of 0 for when no valid input is present.

*   **`output logic o_valid;`:**
    *   Declares an output port `o_valid` which indicates whether a valid input (i.e., at least one bit is high) is present.

*   **`localparam ENCODED_WIDTH = $clog2(WIDTH);`:**
    *   Defines a local parameter called `ENCODED_WIDTH` to hold the number of bits required for the encoded output.  Using a local parameter makes the code more readable and easier to maintain, as it avoids repeated calculations of `$clog2(WIDTH)`.

*   **`always_comb begin ... end`:**
    *   This block describes the combinational logic of the priority encoder. The logic is evaluated whenever any of the inputs change.

*   **`o_valid = 1'b0;`**
    *   Initializes the `o_valid` output to 0. This ensures that the output is invalid if no input is high.

*   **`o_encoded = 0;`**
    * Initializes the `o_encoded` to 0. If no valid input is present the output will be zero.

*   **`for (int i = WIDTH - 1; i >= 0; i--) begin ... end`:**
    *   This loop iterates through the input bits from the most significant bit (MSB) to the least significant bit (LSB).  The loop checks each bit to see if it's high. This prioritizes the higher index bits.

*   **`if (i_data[i]) begin ... end`:**
    *   If the current bit `i_data[i]` is high (1), then:

*   **`o_valid = 1'b1;`:**
    *   Sets the `o_valid` output to 1, indicating that a valid input is present.

*   **`o_encoded = i;`:**
    *   Sets the `o_encoded` output to the index `i` of the highest priority bit that is high.

*   **`break;`:**
    *   Exits the loop after finding the highest priority bit. This ensures that only the index of the *highest* priority bit is output.

**Parameterization Details and Design Considerations:**

*   The `WIDTH` parameter controls the number of input bits. The `$clog2(WIDTH)` function dynamically calculates the required number of output bits.
*   The encoder prioritizes the *highest* index input bit. This is achieved by iterating through the input vector from MSB to LSB.
*   The use of a `for` loop inside an `always_comb` block infers combinational logic. This is generally synthesizable but can have performance implications for very large values of `WIDTH`. For very wide encoders, tree-based architectures might be preferable for better performance (although they add complexity).
*   The `o_valid` signal is crucial for indicating whether the `o_encoded` output is valid. Without it, the `o_encoded` output would always have some value, even when the input is all zeros.

## 4. Testbench

```verilog
module tb_priority_encoder;

  // Parameters
  parameter WIDTH = 8;

  // Signals
  logic [WIDTH-1:0] i_data;
  logic [$clog2(WIDTH):0] o_encoded;
  logic o_valid;

  // Instantiate the priority encoder
  priority_encoder #(
    .WIDTH(WIDTH)
  ) u_priority_encoder (
    .i_data(i_data),
    .o_encoded(o_encoded),
    .o_valid(o_valid)
  );

  // Clock (not strictly needed for combinational logic, but good practice)
  logic clk;
  always #5 clk = ~clk;  // 10ns period

  initial begin
    clk = 0;

    // Test Cases

    // 1. No input asserted
    i_data = 0;
    #10;
    $display("Test 1: No input - i_data=%b, o_encoded=%d, o_valid=%b", i_data, o_encoded, o_valid);
    assert (o_encoded == 0 && o_valid == 0) else $error("Test 1 Failed!");

    // 2. Single input asserted (LSB)
    i_data = 1;
    #10;
    $display("Test 2: LSB asserted - i_data=%b, o_encoded=%d, o_valid=%b", i_data, o_encoded, o_valid);
    assert (o_encoded == 0 && o_valid == 1) else $error("Test 2 Failed!");

    // 3. Single input asserted (MSB)
    i_data = 1 << (WIDTH - 1);
    #10;
    $display("Test 3: MSB asserted - i_data=%b, o_encoded=%d, o_valid=%b", i_data, o_encoded, o_valid);
    assert (o_encoded == WIDTH - 1 && o_valid == 1) else $error("Test 3 Failed!");

    // 4. Multiple inputs asserted
    i_data = 'b10101010;
    #10;
    $display("Test 4: Multiple inputs - i_data=%b, o_encoded=%d, o_valid=%b", i_data, o_encoded, o_valid);
    assert (o_encoded == 7 && o_valid == 1) else $error("Test 4 Failed!");

    // 5. All inputs asserted
    i_data = ~0; // All 1s
    #10;
    $display("Test 5: All inputs asserted - i_data=%b, o_encoded=%d, o_valid=%b", i_data, o_encoded, o_valid);
    assert (o_encoded == WIDTH - 1 && o_valid == 1) else $error("Test 5 Failed!");

    // 6. Change the WIDTH parameter
    $display("Changing WIDTH to 4");
    defparam u_priority_encoder.WIDTH = 4;
    #10;

    // 7. Test with new WIDTH = 4. Single input asserted (MSB)
    i_data = 1 << 3;
    #10;
    $display("Test 7: MSB asserted (WIDTH=4) - i_data=%b, o_encoded=%d, o_valid=%b", i_data, o_encoded, o_valid);
    assert (o_encoded == 3 && o_valid == 1) else $error("Test 7 Failed!");

    // 8. Test with new WIDTH = 4. Multiple inputs asserted
    i_data = 'b1010;
    #10;
    $display("Test 8: Multiple inputs (WIDTH=4) - i_data=%b, o_encoded=%d, o_valid=%b", i_data, o_encoded, o_valid);
    assert (o_encoded == 3 && o_valid == 1) else $error("Test 8 Failed!");


    $finish;
  end

endmodule
```

**Testing Methodology:**

The testbench is designed to cover several critical conditions:

1.  **No Input Asserted:** Verifies that the `o_valid` output is 0 and `o_encoded` is also 0 when no input bit is high.
2.  **Single Input Asserted (LSB):** Checks that the encoder correctly identifies the LSB when it is the only asserted bit.
3.  **Single Input Asserted (MSB):**  Checks that the encoder correctly identifies the MSB when it is the only asserted bit.
4.  **Multiple Inputs Asserted:**  Confirms that the encoder selects the *highest priority* (MSB) bit when multiple bits are asserted.
5.  **All Inputs Asserted:** Checks that the encoder correctly identifies the MSB when all input bits are high.
6.  **Change Parameter:** The testbench can also change the parameter in the middle of the simulation to test various parameter configurations and re-test the cases.

Each test case sets the `i_data` input to a specific pattern, waits for a short period (10 time units), and then checks the `o_encoded` and `o_valid` outputs using assertions.  The `$display` statements provide visibility into the signal values during simulation.  The `assert` statements will report an error if the actual output does not match the expected output. The clock is provided so that the changes in the signals can settle down before the assertions occur.

## 5. Expected Output

The expected output from the testbench should be a series of display messages showing the input and output values for each test case, followed by either a message indicating "Test Passed!" or an error message if an assertion fails.  Here is an example of what the console output should look like:

```
Test 1: No input - i_data=00000000, o_encoded=0, o_valid=0
Test 2: LSB asserted - i_data=00000001, o_encoded=0, o_valid=1
Test 3: MSB asserted - i_data=10000000, o_encoded=7, o_valid=1
Test 4: Multiple inputs - i_data=10101010, o_encoded=7, o_valid=1
Test 5: All inputs asserted - i_data=11111111, o_encoded=7, o_valid=1
Changing WIDTH to 4
Test 7: MSB asserted (WIDTH=4) - i_data=1000, o_encoded=3, o_valid=1
Test 8: Multiple inputs (WIDTH=4) - i_data=1010, o_encoded=3, o_valid=1
```

If any assertion fails, an error message from the `assert` statement will be printed to the console.

## 6. Notes

*   **Limitations:** This implementation uses a simple `for` loop, which can become slow for very large input widths. For very large widths (e.g., > 64), a tree-based implementation of the priority encoder would provide better performance. Also, the testbench does not cover all possible input combinations and timing scenarios.
*   **Optimizations:**
    *   For smaller widths, the `for` loop is generally efficient enough.
    *   For larger widths, consider a tree-based implementation.  This involves breaking the encoder into smaller blocks and combining their outputs in a hierarchical manner.
*   **Potential Enhancements:**
    *   Add support for configurable priority direction (MSB-first or LSB-first).
    *   Implement a pipeline stage to improve performance at the cost of latency.
*   **Verification Best Practices:**
    *   Thoroughly test with different values of the `WIDTH` parameter.
    *   Use directed tests to cover specific corner cases (e.g., all zeros, single bit asserted, multiple bits asserted).
    *   Use constrained-random testing to generate a wide variety of input patterns.
    *   Perform functional coverage analysis to ensure that all important code paths and functional scenarios have been tested.
*   **Synthesis Best Practices:**
    *   Use appropriate synthesis constraints to guide the synthesis tool to meet performance requirements.
    *   Consider using a technology-specific library to optimize the design for the target FPGA or ASIC technology.
    *   Analyze the synthesis reports to identify any potential performance bottlenecks or resource utilization issues.
    *   Perform place-and-route to verify timing and routing congestion.
