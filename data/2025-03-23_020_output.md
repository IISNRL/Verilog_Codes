# Task 20: Advanced Cryptographic Coprocessor - Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Coprocessor

## 1. Task Description

**Problem Aim:** The aim of this task is to design a hardware coprocessor specifically tailored for accelerating Post-Quantum Cryptographic (PQC) algorithms.  We will focus on the architectural design considerations for such a coprocessor, not a full implementation of a specific algorithm. This will involve considering factors like speed, area, power efficiency, and security against side-channel attacks.

**Overview:** Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) refers to cryptographic systems that are believed to be secure against attacks by quantum computers.  Traditional public-key cryptography, such as RSA and ECC, is vulnerable to Shor's algorithm, which can be efficiently executed on a sufficiently large quantum computer.  PQC algorithms are designed to be resistant to both classical and quantum attacks. Examples include lattice-based cryptography (Kyber, Dilithium), code-based cryptography (Classic McEliece), multivariate cryptography (Rainbow), and hash-based cryptography (SPHINCS+).  These algorithms generally involve complex mathematical operations over large data structures, making them computationally intensive. This coprocessor aims to offload these intensive computations from a general-purpose processor.

**Significance:** The significance of designing a specialized PQC coprocessor lies in the following:

*   **Performance:** PQC algorithms often have significantly higher computational costs than classical cryptography.  Hardware acceleration can dramatically improve performance, enabling real-time or high-throughput cryptographic operations.
*   **Security:** A hardware coprocessor can provide a more secure environment for key storage and cryptographic operations, reducing the attack surface. Specifically, protecting against key extraction and SCA is more feasible with dedicated hardware.
*   **Power Efficiency:** Specialized hardware can be optimized for power consumption, making it suitable for embedded systems and resource-constrained environments.
*   **Scalability:** As quantum computers become more powerful, larger key sizes and more complex PQC algorithms will be required. A hardware coprocessor can be designed to handle these increasing demands.

**Focus of this Report:** This report outlines a *conceptual* architecture and key design considerations for a PQC coprocessor. It doesn't delve into the specific implementation of a complete cryptographic algorithm due to the immense complexity and the diverse nature of different PQC candidates. Instead, it focuses on the common computational kernels and architectural elements needed for PQC acceleration, allowing for a more general and reusable design. We will also discuss potential security vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies in the context of hardware implementations.

## 2. Verilog Codes (Illustrative Example - Polynomial Multiplier Kernel)

This section presents a *simplified example* focusing on the polynomial multiplication kernel, a common building block in lattice-based PQC algorithms like Kyber and Dilithium.  This is only a snippet demonstrating a modular multiplication operation with optimization considerations. A full coprocessor would require much more complex modules.

```verilog
module modular_multiplier #(
  parameter DATA_WIDTH = 16,
  parameter MODULUS    = 3329 // Example modulus for Kyber/Dilithium
) (
  input clk,
  input rst,
  input enable,
  input [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] a,
  input [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] b,
  output logic [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] result,
  output logic busy
);

  reg [DATA_WIDTH*2-1:0] product;
  reg [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] temp_result;
  reg ready_for_reduction;


  always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
    if (rst) begin
      product <= 0;
      result <= 0;
      busy <= 0;
      ready_for_reduction <= 0;
    end else if (enable && !busy) begin
      product <= a * b;
      busy <= 1;
      ready_for_reduction <= 1;
    end else if (ready_for_reduction) begin
      // Implement Barrett Reduction or similar modular reduction technique here.
      //  This is a simplified example; a full implementation would be more complex.
      //  Example:  Reduce 'product' modulo 'MODULUS' and store in 'temp_result'.
      //  A more sophisticated implementation would pipeline this reduction.

      // Here, we are doing a naive subtraction which is not optimal, but illustrative

      temp_result <= product[DATA_WIDTH-1:0];
      product <= product - (MODULUS * {DATA_WIDTH{1'b1}}); //This is incorrect, intended to show a subtraction.

      if(product[DATA_WIDTH*2 - 1: DATA_WIDTH])
          temp_result <= temp_result; //Do nothing
      else
          temp_result <= temp_result + MODULUS;
      result <= temp_result; //assign temp_result
      busy <= 0;
      ready_for_reduction <= 0;

    end
    else
        busy <= busy; //Maintain the busy signal
  end

endmodule
```

## 3. Code Explanation

The `modular_multiplier` module performs modular multiplication of two `DATA_WIDTH`-bit inputs `a` and `b` modulo `MODULUS`.  It includes the following key elements:

*   **Parameterization:** `DATA_WIDTH` and `MODULUS` are parameters, allowing the module to be configured for different data sizes and moduli used in various PQC algorithms.
*   **Multiplication:** The module first calculates the product of `a` and `b`, storing the result in the `product` register. This register has twice the `DATA_WIDTH` to accommodate the full product.
*   **Modular Reduction:**  The critical part of the module is the modular reduction step.  A naive subtraction is used in the example, but, for real-world applications, a more efficient algorithm like Barrett reduction, Montgomery reduction, or a precomputed lookup table would be used to reduce the `product` modulo `MODULUS`. This block will be a complex block in any PQC hardware implementation, and it's often highly optimized.
*   **Pipelining (Implicit):** The `busy` signal enables rudimentary pipelining.  It indicates when the multiplier is busy performing the calculation and prevents new inputs from being accepted until the result is ready.  A fully pipelined design would further break down the multiplication and modular reduction stages into multiple pipeline stages for increased throughput.
*   **Design Considerations:**
    *   **Modulus Selection:** The choice of `MODULUS` is crucial and depends on the specific PQC algorithm.  Different algorithms use different moduli, and the modular reduction implementation needs to be tailored accordingly.
    *   **Modular Reduction Algorithm:**  The performance of the modular reduction algorithm is the bottleneck.  Choosing and implementing an efficient algorithm is essential.
    *   **Data Width:**  The `DATA_WIDTH` should be chosen carefully to match the bit-width of the coefficients used in the PQC algorithm.

## 4. Testbench

```verilog
module modular_multiplier_tb;

  parameter DATA_WIDTH = 16;
  parameter MODULUS    = 3329;

  logic clk;
  logic rst;
  logic enable;
  logic [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] a;
  logic [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] b;
  logic [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] result;
  logic busy;

  modular_multiplier #(
    .DATA_WIDTH(DATA_WIDTH),
    .MODULUS(MODULUS)
  ) uut (
    .clk(clk),
    .rst(rst),
    .enable(enable),
    .a(a),
    .b(b),
    .result(result),
    .busy(busy)
  );

  // Clock Generation
  always #5 clk = ~clk;

  initial begin
    clk = 0;
    rst = 1;
    enable = 0;
    a = 0;
    b = 0;

    #10 rst = 0; // Release reset

    // Test Case 1:  Simple multiplication
    enable = 1;
    a = 10;
    b = 20;
    #20 enable = 0;
    #20;

    // Test Case 2: Multiplication resulting in a number greater than modulus
    enable = 1;
    a = 3000;
    b = 2000;
    #20 enable = 0;
    #20;

    // Test Case 3: Multiplication with one input being zero
    enable = 1;
    a = 0;
    b = 100;
    #20 enable = 0;
    #20;

    // Test Case 4: Multiplication with modulus as one of the numbers
    enable = 1;
    a = MODULUS;
    b = 100;
    #20 enable = 0;
    #20;

    // Test Case 5: Back-to-back multiplications
    enable = 1;
    a = 5;
    b = 7;
    #10;
    a = 1234;
    b = 5678;
    #20 enable = 0;
    #20;

    $finish;
  end

endmodule
```

**Testing Methodology:**

The testbench tests the `modular_multiplier` module by applying various input patterns and verifying the output. The test cases are designed to cover the following scenarios:

*   **Simple Multiplication:**  Tests basic functionality.
*   **Multiplication Exceeding Modulus:** Checks that the modular reduction is working correctly when the product is larger than the modulus.
*   **Multiplication with Zero:** Ensures that the module handles zero inputs correctly.
*   **Multiplication with Modulus:** Test the cases when the inputs contain the modulus as one of the numbers
*   **Back-to-Back Multiplications:** Verifies that the `busy` signal correctly handles consecutive multiplication operations without waiting for the previous result before accepting another input.

## 5. Expected Output

The expected output for each test case depends on the specific modular reduction algorithm used.  For the simplified subtraction approach, the following is approximate. A proper Barrett reduction implementation would provide a much more accurate remainder. The following expected values assume a proper implementation.

*   **Test Case 1 (a=10, b=20):** `result` should be 200 % 3329 = 200, `busy` should be asserted during the calculation and de-asserted when the result is ready.
*   **Test Case 2 (a=3000, b=2000):** `result` should be 6000000 % 3329 = 1366, `busy` behavior as above.
*   **Test Case 3 (a=0, b=100):** `result` should be 0, `busy` behavior as above.
*   **Test Case 4 (a=MODULUS, b=100):** `result` should be (3329 * 100) % 3329 = 0, `busy` behavior as above.
*   **Test Case 5 (a=5, b=7 then a=1234, b=5678):** First calculation, `result` should be 35, Second result 1234*5678 = 7006572 % 3329 = 342. Busy signal should show these executions.

The simulator waveforms should show the inputs `a` and `b`, the `enable` signal, the `busy` signal, and the `result`. The `busy` signal should be asserted when `enable` is high and de-asserted when the result is ready.  The `result` signal should hold the correct modular product after the `busy` signal is de-asserted.

**Waveform Snippet (Illustrative):**

```
Time     | clk | rst | enable | a   | b   | busy | result |
---------|-----|-----|--------|-----|-----|------|--------|
0        |  0  |  1  |   0    |  0  |  0  |  0   |    0   |
10       |  0  |  0  |   1    | 10  | 20  |  0   |    0   |
15       |  1  |  0  |   1    | 10  | 20  |  1   |    0   | (busy asserted)
20       |  0  |  0  |   0    | 10  | 20  |  1   |    0   |
30       |  0  |  0  |   0    | 10  | 20  |  0   |  200   | (busy deasserted, result valid)
```

## 6. Notes

*   **Limitations:** This is a simplified example, and it only implements a single modular multiplication operation.  A full PQC coprocessor would need to support a wide range of mathematical operations, including polynomial addition, subtraction, and inversion; matrix operations; and random number generation.
*   **Optimizations:**
    *   **Pipelining:**  Implement a fully pipelined architecture to improve throughput.
    *   **Parallelism:** Exploit parallelism by performing multiple operations concurrently.  For example, multiple modular multiplications can be performed in parallel.
    *   **Specialized Hardware:** Use specialized hardware units for specific operations, such as finite field multipliers and adders.
    *   **Memory Management:** Optimize memory access patterns to reduce latency and power consumption.  Cache frequently used data and use DMA controllers to transfer data efficiently.
*   **Potential Enhancements:**
    *   **Multiple PQC Algorithms:**  Support multiple PQC algorithms by implementing a reconfigurable architecture that can be adapted to different algorithms.
    *   **Side-Channel Attack Mitigation:** Implement countermeasures against side-channel attacks, such as masking, hiding, and dual-rail logic.  The Montgomery Ladder is useful against timing attacks.
    *   **Low Power Consumption:** Optimize the coprocessor for low power consumption by using clock gating, voltage scaling, and power-aware routing.
*   **Security Considerations:**
    *   **Side-Channel Attacks (SCA):** Hardware implementations of cryptographic algorithms are vulnerable to SCAs, which exploit information leaked through power consumption, timing variations, electromagnetic radiation, and other physical characteristics. Mitigation techniques should be included.
    *   **Fault Injection Attacks:**  These attacks involve injecting faults into the system to compromise its security. Protection against fault injection requires careful design and implementation of error detection and correction mechanisms.
    *   **Hardware Trojans:** Malicious circuits can be inserted into the hardware during the design or manufacturing process. Trojan detection techniques are crucial to ensure the integrity of the coprocessor.
*   **Verification Best Practices:**
    *   **Functional Verification:** Use comprehensive testbenches and formal verification techniques to verify the correctness of the implementation.
    *   **Performance Verification:**  Measure the performance of the coprocessor using benchmarks and performance analysis tools.
    *   **Security Verification:** Conduct side-channel analysis and fault injection testing to assess the resistance of the coprocessor to attacks.
    *   **Synthesis and Place-and-Route:** Synthesize and place-and-route the design to evaluate its area, power consumption, and timing performance.
    *   **Formal Equivalence Checking:** Use formal equivalence checking tools to verify that the synthesized netlist is equivalent to the RTL code.

This report provides a starting point for designing a PQC coprocessor. The specific design choices and optimizations will depend on the target application and the specific PQC algorithms that need to be supported.
