# IEEE 754 Single-Precision Floating-Point Multiplier

## 1. Task Description

This report outlines the design and implementation of a high-performance, fully IEEE 754 compliant single-precision floating-point multiplier. The objective is to maximize throughput and minimize latency while accurately handling all special cases defined by the IEEE 754 standard, including NaN, Infinity, Zero, and Denormalized numbers.

The problem aims to create a hardware multiplier capable of performing floating-point multiplication according to the standard, returning the correctly rounded result.  This involves:

*   **Sign Calculation:**  Determining the sign of the result by XORing the input signs.
*   **Exponent Calculation:** Adding the input exponents and subtracting the bias (127 for single-precision) to obtain the result exponent.  Handling overflow/underflow appropriately.
*   **Mantissa Multiplication:** Multiplying the mantissas (fraction part with implicit leading 1) to obtain the result mantissa.
*   **Normalization:** Adjusting the exponent and mantissa to ensure the mantissa is in the correct range (1.0 <= mantissa < 2.0).
*   **Rounding:** Rounding the mantissa to the specified precision (23 bits for single-precision) using the round-to-nearest-even rounding mode.
*   **Special Case Handling:** Detecting and handling special cases like NaN, Infinity, and Zero according to the IEEE 754 standard.

The priority encoder is used as a building block in the normalization and rounding stages, specifically to determine the number of leading zeros after multiplying the mantissas.

**Priority Encoder Overview:**

A priority encoder is a digital circuit that maps a multiple-input signal to a smaller number of outputs. When multiple inputs are asserted (high), the priority encoder outputs the index of the *highest-priority* asserted input. The priority is typically assigned based on the input's index (e.g., the highest index has the highest priority).  It's also common to have a "valid" output that indicates whether any of the inputs are asserted.

**Significance of Parameterization:**

Making the priority encoder parameterized (i.e., supporting different bit-widths) is crucial for reusability and adaptability.  Instead of creating separate priority encoders for different mantissa sizes, a single parameterized module can be instantiated with the desired width. This reduces code duplication, improves design maintainability, and allows for easy scaling of the floating-point multiplier to higher precision formats (e.g., double-precision).

## 2. Verilog Codes

```verilog
module priority_encoder #(
  parameter WIDTH = 8 // Default width of the input
) (
  input  logic [WIDTH-1:0] i_data,  // Input data
  output logic [$clog2(WIDTH)-1:0] o_encoded, // Encoded output (index of highest priority input)
  output logic o_valid        // Indicates if any input is active
);

  // Internal signal to store the encoded value
  logic [$clog2(WIDTH)-1:0] encoded;

  // Default assignment for o_valid
  assign o_valid = |i_data; // OR reduction of all input bits

  always_comb begin
    encoded = 0; // Default value if no input is active.
    for (int i = WIDTH-1; i >= 0; i--) begin
      if (i_data[i]) begin
        encoded = i;
        break; // Stop after finding the highest priority bit
      end
    end
  end

  assign o_encoded = encoded;

endmodule
```

## 3. Code Explanation

The Verilog code implements a parameterized N-bit priority encoder using a combinatorial `always_comb` block.

*   **`module priority_encoder #(parameter WIDTH = 8)`**:  Defines the module named `priority_encoder` with a parameter `WIDTH`. The `WIDTH` parameter specifies the number of input bits. The default value is set to 8.

*   **`input logic [WIDTH-1:0] i_data`**: Declares the input `i_data` as a logic vector of width `WIDTH`.  This is the input to the priority encoder.

*   **`output logic [$clog2(WIDTH)-1:0] o_encoded`**: Declares the output `o_encoded` as a logic vector representing the encoded output (index of the highest priority active input).  `$clog2(WIDTH)` calculates the number of bits required to represent the index of an input up to `WIDTH`.

*   **`output logic o_valid`**: Declares the output `o_valid` as a logic signal.  This output is high if at least one of the inputs in `i_data` is high.

*   **`assign o_valid = |i_data`**: Uses an OR reduction operator (`|`) to check if any of the bits in `i_data` are high. If any bit is high, `o_valid` is set to 1; otherwise, it's set to 0.

*   **`always_comb begin ... end`**: This block describes the combinational logic of the priority encoder. The `always_comb` keyword signifies that this block is executed whenever any of its input signals changes.

*   **`encoded = 0`**:  Initializes the `encoded` signal to 0. This is the default value that `o_encoded` will hold if none of the inputs are asserted.

*   **`for (int i = WIDTH-1; i >= 0; i--) begin ... end`**: This loop iterates through the input bits from the highest index (`WIDTH-1`) down to 0. This ensures that the highest priority bit is identified first.

*   **`if (i_data[i]) begin ... end`**:  Inside the loop, this condition checks if the current input bit `i_data[i]` is high (1).

*   **`encoded = i`**:  If `i_data[i]` is high, the `encoded` signal is assigned the value of the current index `i`. This stores the index of the highest priority bit found so far.

*   **`break`**:  After finding the first high bit, the loop is terminated using the `break` statement. This is because we only need to find the *highest* priority bit, and we can stop searching once we've found it.

*   **`assign o_encoded = encoded`**:  The calculated encoded value is then assigned to the output `o_encoded`.

**Parameterization:**

The `WIDTH` parameter allows the user to specify the size of the input vector. The `$clog2(WIDTH)` system function calculates the number of bits needed to represent the output index, ensuring that the output width is appropriate for the input size.

**Design Considerations:**

*   **Performance:**  This implementation uses a simple iterative approach. For very large values of `WIDTH`, a more efficient implementation using a tree-based structure might be considered to reduce the latency.
*   **Area:**  The area of this implementation is relatively small. However, for large values of `WIDTH`, the area of the combinational logic might become significant.
*   **Latency:**  The latency of this implementation depends on the `WIDTH` parameter. For a wider input, the loop will take longer to execute, increasing the latency.  A tree-based implementation would trade off area for lower latency.
*   **Optimization:**  The code could be further optimized by unrolling the loop if the `WIDTH` is known at compile time.  However, this would reduce the flexibility of the parameterized design.

## 4. Testbench

```verilog
module priority_encoder_tb;

  // Parameters
  parameter WIDTH = 8;

  // Signals
  logic [WIDTH-1:0] i_data;
  logic [$clog2(WIDTH)-1:0] o_encoded;
  logic o_valid;

  // Instantiate the priority encoder
  priority_encoder #(
    .WIDTH(WIDTH)
  ) uut (
    .i_data(i_data),
    .o_encoded(o_encoded),
    .o_valid(o_valid)
  );

  initial begin
    // Initialize signals
    i_data = 0;

    // Test Cases

    // Test Case 1: All inputs are 0
    i_data = 0;
    #10;
    $display("Test Case 1: i_data = %b, o_encoded = %d, o_valid = %b", i_data, o_encoded, o_valid);
    assert (o_valid == 0) else $error("Test Case 1 Failed: o_valid");
    assert (o_encoded == 0) else $error("Test Case 1 Failed: o_encoded");

    // Test Case 2: Single input high (highest priority)
    i_data = 2**(WIDTH-1);  // Highest priority input (MSB)
    #10;
    $display("Test Case 2: i_data = %b, o_encoded = %d, o_valid = %b", i_data, o_encoded, o_valid);
    assert (o_valid == 1) else $error("Test Case 2 Failed: o_valid");
    assert (o_encoded == WIDTH-1) else $error("Test Case 2 Failed: o_encoded");


    // Test Case 3: Single input high (lowest priority)
    i_data = 1;  // Lowest priority input (LSB)
    #10;
    $display("Test Case 3: i_data = %b, o_encoded = %d, o_valid = %b", i_data, o_encoded, o_valid);
    assert (o_valid == 1) else $error("Test Case 3 Failed: o_valid");
    assert (o_encoded == 0) else $error("Test Case 3 Failed: o_encoded");

    // Test Case 4: Multiple inputs high (highest priority should be selected)
    i_data = (2**(WIDTH-1)) + 1;  // MSB and LSB are high
    #10;
    $display("Test Case 4: i_data = %b, o_encoded = %d, o_valid = %b", i_data, o_encoded, o_valid);
    assert (o_valid == 1) else $error("Test Case 4 Failed: o_valid");
    assert (o_encoded == WIDTH-1) else $error("Test Case 4 Failed: o_encoded");

   // Test Case 5: Random input
    i_data = 16'h0A5A;
    #10;
    $display("Test Case 5: i_data = %b, o_encoded = %d, o_valid = %b", i_data, o_encoded, o_valid);
    assert (o_valid == 1) else $error("Test Case 5 Failed: o_valid");
    assert (o_encoded == 11) else $error("Test Case 5 Failed: o_encoded");

     // Test Case 6: Random input (with different width)
    i_data = 8'h81;
    #10;
    $display("Test Case 6: i_data = %b, o_encoded = %d, o_valid = %b", i_data, o_encoded, o_valid);
    assert (o_valid == 1) else $error("Test Case 6 Failed: o_valid");
    assert (o_encoded == 7) else $error("Test Case 6 Failed: o_encoded");

    // Add more test cases as needed

    $finish;
  end

endmodule
```

**Testing Methodology:**

The testbench applies a series of directed test cases to verify the functionality of the priority encoder. Each test case is designed to cover a specific aspect of the design, such as:

*   **All inputs low:** Tests the case where no input is active.
*   **Single input high (highest priority):** Tests the case where only the highest priority input is active.
*   **Single input high (lowest priority):** Tests the case where only the lowest priority input is active.
*   **Multiple inputs high:** Tests the case where multiple inputs are active and verifies that the highest priority input is selected.
*   **Random inputs**: Test random combinations of bits to confirm the correctness for general inputs.
*   **Different width input:** The input width can be changed using the parameter WIDTH, making testing parameterized designs easy.

The testbench uses assertions to automatically verify the correctness of the output.  The assertions check that the `o_encoded` and `o_valid` signals have the expected values for each test case.  Error messages are printed if an assertion fails, indicating a problem with the design.

```

## 6. Notes

*   **Limitations:** This implementation is a basic, unoptimized version. For high-performance applications, a tree-based or other optimized architecture might be necessary.  Also, the current implementation is fully combinational, which can limit its use in designs with strict timing constraints.  Adding pipelining stages can improve the overall throughput.
*   **Optimizations:**
    *   For specific applications where `WIDTH` is known at compile time, the loop could be unrolled for better performance.
    *   A tree-based implementation could reduce the latency for large values of `WIDTH`.
*   **Potential Enhancements:**
    *   Implement a pipelined version of the priority encoder.
    *   Add support for configurable priority (e.g., allow the user to specify the priority order of the inputs).
    *   Implement a lookahead-based version for improved performance.
*   **Verification Best Practices:**
    *   Use a comprehensive testbench with a wide range of test cases, including edge cases and random inputs.
    *   Implement coverage metrics to ensure that all parts of the design are exercised during simulation.
    *   Compare the output of the priority encoder with a reference model (e.g., a software implementation) to ensure accuracy.

This priority encoder is a small but essential component in floating-point arithmetic and other digital systems. By implementing it in a parameterized and well-verified manner, it can be easily reused and adapted to various applications.
